# Building a REST API in Spring Boot

Great content of my first blog

    I created `.env` file at the root.
    Backticks inside backticks? `` `No problem.` ``

    ```
    {
      learning: "Markdown",
      showing: "block code snippet"
    }
    ```

    ```js
    const x = "Block code snippet in JS";
    console.log(x);
    ```
